# Wallet
Backup and save your passes like boarding pass or event tickets easily and secure in one place. This is Wallet.

Wallet is a Firebase powered open-source project which let's you upload .pkpass files and show them directly on your browser on your desktop, tablet or mobile device.

The project is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/), a material design library. You can create an account directly on the website: https://wallet.schmuckli.dev/ and start backup your passes.
